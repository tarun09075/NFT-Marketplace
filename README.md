# NFT Marketplace

## Project Description
This project is a simple decentralized NFT marketplace built on Ethereum using Solidity. It allows users to mint their own NFTs, list them for sale, purchase NFTs from others, and withdraw their earnings securely through smart contracts.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to provide an easy-to-use, transparent, and trustless marketplace where creators and collectors can seamlessly interact without intermediaries. The NFT Marketplace empowers digital ownership by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure authenticity and security.

## Key Features
- **NFT Minting:** Users can mint unique NFTs directly on the blockchain.
- **Listing NFTs:** Owners can list their NFTs for sale at a chosen price.
- **Buying NFTs:** Buyers can purchase listed NFTs by sending cryptocurrency.
- **Secure Withdrawals:** Sellers can withdraw their earnings safely from the contract.
- **Trustless Transactions:** All operations are governed by smart contracts ensuring transparency.

## Future Scope
- Integration with ERC-1155 multi-token standard for batch minting.
- Support for auctions and bidding.
- IPFS integration for decentralized metadata storage.
- Frontend DApp to improve user experience.
- Royalty mechanisms for creators on secondary sales.
